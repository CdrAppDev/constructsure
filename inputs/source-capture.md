**Executive Summary**

ConstructSure is positioned to become the first purpose-built financial control and transparency platform for the residential renovation and restoration market. Unlike traditional construction management (CM) systems that focus primarily on workflows, scheduling, communication, or design, ConstructSure directly addresses the core financial risk that homeowners, contractors, and institutional capital face: misaligned payment timing, poor visibility into progress, and lack of bank-grade documentation over project funds.

ConstructSure fully differentiates itself by introducing independent funds custody, structured milestone payments tied to industry-standard SOVs (Schedule of Values), and lien-integrated releases. By inserting a neutral, transparent, rules-based financial layer between contractors and homeowners, ConstructSure eliminates the historical opacity around payment practices and creates a shared financial source of truth.

From the institutional perspective, ConstructSure provides added benefit via risk reduction. Banks/Insurers largely rely on legacy draw processes that implicitly create unnecessary risk exposure and are often too slow, too expensive, or too manual for residential projects. Draw fraud, overpayment, and non-completion remain significant risks. ConstructSure modernizes this ecosystem by fully automating progress verification, tracking the disbursement lifecycle, and providing audit-ready documentation. None of the existing contractor-focused CM tools offer this capability, making ConstructSure a complementary and highly defensible solution for institutions seeking competitive advantage in renovation and restoration capital.

Contractors also benefit from ConstructSure's processes. Today, smaller contractors are forced to operate as de facto financial managers—tracking deposits, reconciling payments, requesting/chasing draws, and handling lien documentation—while managing construction operations. ConstructSure offloads these administrative burdens by standardizing payment timelines and ensuring funds remain available as each project progresses. Contractors receive faster, clearer, and more reliable payments, enabling healthier cash flow and reducing disputes.

Homeowners gain full transparency into progress and payments. In an industry where mistrust is common, ConstructSure becomes a trust-enhancing neutral platform: documenting progress, verifying milestones, securing funds, and releasing payments only when conditions are met. This addresses homeowners' top fear—losing money to unfinished or abandoned projects—while improving contractor professionalism and predictability.

In summary, ConstructSure's competitive advantage lies not in replicating construction workflow tools, but in solving the most critical financial weakness across the residential renovation industry. No entity offers true independent fund control, milestone-based disbursements, or lender/insurer-aligned compliance. This positions ConstructSure as the financial infrastructure layer for the renovation economy—deeply complementary to existing CM platforms and uniquely positioned to partner with banks, insurance carriers, and large contractor networks.

**Slide 1 (Intro):** "We are developing a funds administrator platform that manages and protects payments for homeowners, contractors, lenders, and insurers during residential renovation/restoration projects."

**Slide 2 (The Problem):**
- Residential construction lacks financial infrastructure.
- Payments are front-loaded, poorly verified, and weakly controlled.
- No standardized Schedule of Values.
- Results in misallocated capital, liens, disputes, abandoned projects, and inflated contractor costs.
- Over $40B lost annually to fraud, slow/no-pay, and payment friction.

**Slide 3 (Why This Matters):**
- Homeowners: Prepay for unverified work, contractor flight risk, liens.
- Contractors: Slow payment, cashflow strain, sub-contractor flight, factoring dependence.
- Lenders: Limited fund visibility, renovation loan risk, high mitigation costs.
- Insurers: Absence of audit quality documentation, limited financial control, resource constrained adjuster oversight.
- Bottom Line: Residential construction operates without commercial-grade controls.

**Slide 4 (The ConstructSure Solution):**
- Technology-enabled, third-party funds administrator.
- Granular, milestone-based (SOV) fund governance.
- Homeowner-Contractor verified approvals tied directly to payment.
- Lien waiver based payment applications.
- Documented, approved, and pre-funded change orders.
- Trust infrastructure for residential construction.

**Slide 5 (How It Works):**
- Project scope converted into digital SOV.
- Funds (20% forward balance) deposited into NewCo-administered account.
- Milestones verified digitally via NewCo platform.
- Approved payments released within 1–2 days.
- Permanent audit trail.

**Slide 6 (Product Snapshot):**
- Digital SOV engine.
- Milestone verification workflows.
- Funds administration and ledger system.
- Lien waiver and compliance tracking.
- Real-time dashboards and lender portals.

**Slide 7 (Market Opportunity):**
- $560B annual U.S. renovation market.
- 6–8M major (> $120,000) projects annually.
- Highly fragmented, financially inefficient industry.
- NewCo monetizes financial control.

**Slide 8 (TAM / SAM / SOM):**
- TAM: $560B - $600B Annually (Home Improvement Research Institute 2024; Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies 2022).
- Contractor Share: 40% of renovators hired a contractor. Dollar value was 78.5% for those that hired contractors.
- SAM: $440B (78.5% of $560B) (Statista 2025).
- Spend Distribution: Average range $17,947 - $78,308. Top 10% invested $180,000+. Excludes disaster repair. (Architectural Digest 2023)
- SOM: $44B (10% of SAM).
- Growth Rate: 4.6% CAGR (3.4% forecast 2025; to $716B by 2030; Grand View Research).

**Investor Overview**

NewCo is building the financial infrastructure layer for the $450B U.S. home renovation / restoration market.

Residential projects currently operate without the financial controls standard in commercial construction. Homeowners prepay for unverified work. Contractors suffer slow and inconsistent payments. Lenders/Insurers lack visibility into fund usage. This breakdown creates misallocated capital, contractor flight, liens, litigation, and over $40B annually in payment friction and project failure.

NewCo solves this by acting as a technology-enabled, third-party funds administrator. We introduce granular schedule-of-values frameworks, verified milestone approvals, automated progress-to-payment workflows, and real-time audit trails. Funds move only when work is verified. Every dollar is tracked. Every milestone is documented.

NewCo is positioning to become the operating layer for residential home renovation and restoration capital—unlocking protected homeowners, healthier contractors, and safer institutional outlays.

We are a funds administrator. We manage and protect payments for homeowners, contractors, and lenders/insurers during home renovation and restoration projects.

Our platform is applicable to homeowners, contractors, lenders, and insurers — governing renovation funds with commercial-grade discipline. Revenue opportunities exist through per-project administration fees, transaction revenue, contractor subscriptions, lender/insurer platform licensing, and funds administration account balance generated interest.

We are raising $750,000 via SAFE to implement our MVP platform, launch an initial pilot market, identify channel partnerships, and validate transaction volume.
