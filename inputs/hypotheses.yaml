    problem: "Residential contractors experience chronic cash flow strain from slow and unpredictable payment cycles, forcing reliance on factoring or self-financing and creating downstream non-payment risk for subcontractors"
    source: [S1, S2, S3]
    evidence_signals:
      - "S1: 'smaller contractors are forced to operate as de facto financial managers—tracking deposits, reconciling payments, requesting/chasing draws, and handling lien documentation'"
      - "S1: 'Contractors receive faster, clearer, and more reliable payments' — implies current payments are slow, unclear, unreliable"
      - "S2 Why This Matters: 'Contractors: Slow payment, cashflow strain, sub-contractor flight, factoring dependence'"

      - "S1: 'fully automating progress verification, tracking the disbursement lifecycle, and providing audit-ready documentation' — implies none of this exists today"
      - "S2 Why This Matters: 'Lenders: Limited fund visibility, renovation loan risk, high mitigation costs'"
