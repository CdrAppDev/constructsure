    discarded_reasons:
      - "TAM/SAM/SOM sizing claims — belongs to Market workspace, not Problem"
      - "Revenue model details (2.50% fee, interest income) — belongs to Business workspace"
      - "GTM channel list — belongs to Market/Business workspace"
      - "Raise amount ($750K SAFE) — not a problem signal"
      - "Product feature list (digital SOV engine, ledger system) — solution signals, already reversed into problem hypotheses"
      - "Competitive advantage claims (first mover, network effects) — positioning, not problem evidence"

    potentially_overlapping:
      - pair: ["H1", "H5"]
        reason: "H1 (payment-progress disconnect) is a specific instance of H5 (no commercial-grade controls). If H5 is false, H1 is likely false."
        verdict: "kept_separate"
        rationale: "H1 is a specific testable mechanism (SOV/milestone frameworks absent). H5 is a broader structural claim (commercial vs residential control gap). Research could find that residential has some commercial-grade controls (H5 partially false) but still lacks payment-progress linking specifically (H1 true). They test different things."
      - pair: ["H2", "H1"]
        reason: "H2 (homeowner prepayment risk) is a downstream consequence of H1 (no payment-progress link)"
        verdict: "kept_separate"
        rationale: "H2 could be false even if H1 is true — homeowners might be protected by other mechanisms (insurance, bonding, escrow) even without SOV frameworks. Independently testable."
      - pair: ["H4", "H5"]
        reason: "H4 (institutional visibility gap) is a specific stakeholder instance of H5 (no commercial controls)"
        verdict: "kept_separate"
        rationale: "H4 tests institutional-specific processes (draw inspections, adjuster oversight). H5 tests the residential vs commercial control gap broadly. A lender could have good visibility (H4 false) even if residential generally lacks controls (H5 true)."

  specificity_check:
    all_falsifiable: true
    weakest_hypothesis: "H6"
    weakness: "The '$40B' figure is a founder claim repeated across documents. Research may find this number hard to verify precisely — the hypothesis is phrased as 'tens of billions' to allow some range, but the underlying methodology for the $40B claim is unclear."
