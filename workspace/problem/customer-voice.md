## Theme 1: Financial Devastation from Prepayment Loss

> -- Homeowner who lost prepayments to a vanished contractor, Channel News Asia, 2025

> "I told my husband I was done."
> -- Ms. Wong, homeowner after contractor disappeared following final update on May 2, 2023, Channel News Asia, 2025

> Mr. Lim signed a contract for over S$90,000 in January 2023, with additional top-ups for tiles and appliances. "Despite making prepayments covering everything from project confirmation to carpentry progress and appliance purchases, work barely started." He recovered only "over S$20,000" through debt collectors before the interior designers "would reportedly start avoiding the debt collectors by pretending no one was home."
> -- Channel News Asia, 2025

> A homeowner's mother-in-law "received a mass email from the roofer that he unfortunately has gone out of business and will not be completing the work. There were about 75 people included on this email."

## Theme 2: Contractor Cash Flow Anxiety

> "Anxiety becomes a constant companion, sleepless nights follow, and over time, stress can lead to burnout. Sometimes, even the best contractors' focus is affected by the constant worry of whether they'll have the cash to meet their obligations."
> -- Contractor Foreman, 2025

> "A general contractor in Texas had just wrapped up a $300K residential remodel. Everything seemed to be going smoothly, but subcontractors were knocking on his door every week for their payments. Meanwhile, he was still waiting on a $50K invoice from the client, which had been sitting unpaid for over two months. Faced with this payment timing mismatch, he was forced to dip into personal credit cards just to honor his agreements with his subcontractors."
> -- Contractor Foreman, 2025

> A Boise contractor, after adopting real-time cost tracking: "Now, he can accurately predict when funds will arrive, which enables him to make payments to subcontractors without needing loans or credit."
> -- Contractor Foreman, 2025

## Theme 3: Renovation Stress and Emotional Burnout

> "A vast majority (85%) of homeowners undertaking home remodeling report having had significant stress throughout the process, while more than half (57%) experienced 'renovation fatigue' — emotional burnout caused by delays, disruptions, and decision fatigue."
> -- Block Renovation study, 2025

> "Millennials feel the strain of remodeling most acutely, with 67% reporting moderate to high stress and 40% saying that their renovations strained personal relationships, compared to just 15% of Boomers."
> -- Block Renovation study, 2025

> "I have PTSD due to sexual violence and it's really hard to have strange men in my home (which most contractors are). So when something breaks, I immediately go into a panic if it's not something I can fix myself... Additionally, my job is such that I only get paid for the work I do (meeting with clients), so I also have a hard time when contractors give these big windows of time when they might show up because I have to cancel my work and thus not get paid."
> -- PTSD support forum user, describing contractor visit anxiety compounded by financial vulnerability

## Theme 4: Fraud Patterns and Contractor Disappearance

> "The person knocked on our front door and estimated our driveway job. They offer $4000 and did their work next day. Their job was sloppy and incomplete... They continued to ask our payment with either check or cash... They vanished without cleaning the asphalt debris or other material. I tried to contact them but the phone was disconnected."
> -- BBB Scam Tracker report

> "He requested for cash to purchase the materials. He came to pick up the cash and said he would schedule the day & time to do the job. After numerous exchanges of text messages promising to find me a schedule he couldn't come up with one. If he did he wouldn't show up at such time. I then asked for a refund which he agreed to do but never showed up again."
> -- BBB Scam Tracker report

> "Fraudsters raked in nearly $5 million from over 40 homeowners in one US state's contractor scam alone, abandoning half-built houses and vanishing with clients' funds."
> -- Uken Report, 2025

> "Nearly 60% believe that quicker payments could help alleviate inflationary pressures intensified by tariffs."
> -- Built / Talker Research survey, 2025 (n=250)

## Theme 7: Lender and Verification Gaps

> "Inspections provide snapshots, not real-time visibility. Reports confirm what happened on-site, but they don't connect to project budgets, draw requests, or funds disbursement."
> -- Built, construction loan monitoring analysis

> "Lenders often turn to photos, videos, or other media to speed up progress checks when in-person inspections are delayed or impractical. But relying on borrower-submitted visuals introduces a new set of risks... It's increasingly difficult to confirm whether the images are current, unaltered, and from the correct project."
> -- Truepic, draw inspection fraud analysis

> "Without clear audit trails documenting who approved each draw, when, and why, disputes can drag on for months after the draw."
> -- Draw request processing analysis, Sekady
